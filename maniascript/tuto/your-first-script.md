[TOC]

# Your first ShootMania game mode
In this part you'll learn to create your first simple game mode, a deathmatch where the first player to earn 30 points will win the map (using a lightweight version of the Melee gamemode).

## Creating the gamemode
Firstly to be able to write your mode ingame, you have to create a text file with the following code:

```c++
    #Extends "Modes/ShootMania/ModeBase.Script.txt"
```

And then save the file under a name like this: `MyGamemode.Script.txt`.

Now you can launch a local server with your mode or via the map editor (if you want to create/modify a prototype map at the same time) or as said before you can continue in your IDE/text editor but you'll not be able to test/modify in live your script (through the IDE i mean, you can modify through the script editor ingame).

## Create a map

It's time to create a map to test our mode. Launch ManiaPlanet, start the map editor and select a maptype: `MeleeArena` for ShootMania or `Race` for TrackMania. Make a basic map, validate it and save it. Now you can exit the editor.


## Create a server

We have a basic game mode script and a map, all that is missing now is a server to do our tests. In the main menu click on the Local Play button (then Local Network if you are on TrackMania). Click on the Create button and you should see this screen:

![Server creation screen](./img/create-server.png)

1. Click on this box until the `Script` option is selected.
2. Click here to open a window where you can choose `MyGamemode.Script.txt`.

Once it's done click on the Launch button, select the map you created earlier and click on Play.

## Structure of a game mode
A gamemode is divided in several part which match each state of a game. A raw structure of a gamemode is like this:

```c++
    #Extends "Modes/ShootMania/ModeBase.Script.txt"
    
    #Const	CompatibleMapTypes	"MeleeArena"
    #Const	Version				"1.0.0"
    #Const	ScriptName			"MyScript.Script.txt"
    
    #Include "Libs/Nadeo/Settings.Script.txt" as Settings
    #Include "TextLib" as TextLib
    #Include "MathLib" as MathLib
    #Include "Libs/Nadeo/ShootMania/SM.Script.txt" as SM
    #Include "Libs/Nadeo/ShootMania/Score.Script.txt" as Score
    #Include "Libs/Nadeo/Message.Script.txt" as Message

    ***
    
    
    // ---------------------------------- //
    // Functions
    // ---------------------------------- //
    List of the functions of the gamemode
```

We'll explain each part of the script in the next sections but please not first that the `***StartServer***` code are called "Labels". An explanation of the labels is given in the excellent blog post of Steffen, a very active scripter of the community, here (among others explanations about others things in ManiaScript): http://blog.steeffeen.com/2013/10/labels/

### **Library**
```c++
    #Extends "Modes/ShootMania/ModeBase.Script.txt"
    
    #Const	CompatibleMapTypes	"MeleeArena"
    #Const	Version				"1.0.0"
    #Const	ScriptName			"MyScript.Script.txt"
    
    #Include "Libs/Nadeo/Settings.Script.txt" as Settings
    #Include "TextLib" as TextLib
    #Include "MathLib" as MathLib
    #Include "Libs/Nadeo/ShootMania/SM.Script.txt" as SM
    #Include "Libs/Nadeo/ShootMania/Score.Script.txt" as Score
    #Include "Libs/Nadeo/Message.Script.txt" as Message
```
    
This part is used to load all the library required and basic information for the gamemode. `ModeBase` is the most important part because it'll allow you to divide the gamemode for each state of the game and also to have access to all basic functions and variables for a game script.

The `CompatibleMapTypes` constant indicate which type(s) of maps is usable with your script. It can be useful if your mode require a specific type or number of block (for example at least two spawns, with a pole in Royal)

`Version` is... well the version of your script, you can format it as you want.

The `Settings` library allow you to create and use a number of parameters (fixed by you and used by the server owner) on your script like the duration of a round ou the number of kill to do to win.

All `#Include` lines indicate that we want to load a library to the script. A library is a collection of functions/variables which contain script mode to do a specific task (like handling the message, manipulate the player scores/scoretable and more). You can also declare a custom library if you have made one and need it for your gamemode.

### Constants

```c++
    // ---------------------------------- //
    // Constants
    // ---------------------------------- //
     #Const ConstVar ConstValue
```

The constants are a type of variable where you stock a value that will not change during the game and will be accessible anywhere in your script. Usually in these variable you'll keep settings which are non-modifiable by the players/server owner like the number maximum of a player (for example), the list of objects used in the script, the id of the classes, the number minimum of players required for the script, etc...

Declaring a constant variable doesn't need a comma (;) at the end of the line.

### Globales

```c++
    // ---------------------------------- //
    // Globales
    // ---------------------------------- //
    declare Text GlobalVar;
```

Globales are like the constants at the difference that you can modify their value during the game and that you must set a type when you declare (create) them.

### "Body" of the Script
And now we attack the main dish of the script, the labels corresponding to each state of a game.

> **Note:** Not all the parts are mandatory except `Playloop` and `EndRound` or `EndMap` (one of them at least)

#### StartServer

```c++
    ***StartServer***
    ***
    //Code to execute when the server is started
    ***
```
In this block you'll set everything that needs to be set up at the start of the server at risk of not work properly during a game. Usually it's used to build the scoretable, activate the team mode (or not) or listing all the `Actions` (like custom weapons or forced skins) which will be used in the script.

#### StartMap

```c++
    ***StartMap***
    ***
    //Code to execute when a map is loaded
    ***
```
In this part you'll initialize (usually) all the variables which are used to set up a match. It's the place where you reset the global score, setting up variables where will be used during the whole game for example.


#### InitRound

```c++
    ***InitRound***
    ***
    //Code to execute before the beginning of a round
    ***
```
This is the code that you need to execute prior the start of a round, it could be reset the score of a player/team (other than the global score), custom stats, setting up a gameplay sequence, etc...
Note that this section is not mandatory to have your script working.

#### StartRound

```c++
    ***StartRound***
    ***
    //Code to executed when a round is started
    ***
```
This is where you usually setting up few others variables as well as creating the items required to the execution of the script (if needed at the start of the round).

#### Playloop

```c++
    ***Playloop***
    ***
    //Main loop where the code is executed through the duration of the round
    ***
```
The main dish, it's inside this loop that you'll handle everything that happen during a round. From spawning a player to handle the death and more. You have also to set the victory condition(s) somewhere inside to leave the loop (and stop the game).

#### EndRound

```c++
    ***EndRound***
    ***
    //Code to execute at the end of the round
    ***
```
You enter here when you have meet your victory condition(s) and decide what to do at this moment (end the map/match or launch a new round).
If you decide to start a new round, the script will go back at the `InitRound` section and continue the script from there.

This is also the place where you destroy all the objects and bots (because you'll recreate them on the `StartRound`).

#### EndMap

```c++
    ***EndMap***
    ***
    //Code to execute at the end of a match/map
    ***
```
Usually it's used to indicate who won the match and to load the next map.

### Functions

```c++
    // ---------------------------------- //
    // Functions
    // ---------------------------------- //
    //Create your functions from here
```
If you need to create functions (repetition of the same block of code) for your game mode, you have to create them after the `EndMap` section because when the game will compile the script, it's start from the bottom to the up to check if the functions called by script really exist in the library or in the script itself.

## Common variables
Now we can almost start the "real" work, just a bit of explanation about the type of variables existing in ManiaScript as it can change slighty between programming language.

Here is a list of the common types of variables in ManiaScript (or how to declare them):

Type        | ManiaScript type  | Example
---------   | ----------------- | -------
Integer     | Integer           | 1
Real / Float| Real              | 1.
Text        | Text              | 'Im a text'
Boolean     | Boolean           | true
Ident       | Ident             | (see below)
Array       | []                | Player[] (table of Players)

An ident is special kind of variable, it's used to point to an asset (others that images/sound) like a bullet create in the ***ActionMaker***, or a ***skin*** or also an ***aura*** for example.

## Setting up the script

```c++
    #Extends "Modes/ShootMania/ModeBase.Script.txt"
    
    #Const	CompatibleMapTypes	"MeleeArena"
    #Const	Version				"2013-06-24"
    #Const	ScriptName			"Melee.Script.txt"
    
    #Include "MathLib" as MathLib
    #Include "TextLib" as TextLib
    #Include "Libs/Nadeo/Message.Script.txt" as Message
    #Include "Libs/Nadeo/ShootMania/SM.Script.txt" as SM
    #Include "Libs/Nadeo/Interface.Script.txt" as Interface
    #Include "Libs/Nadeo/ShootMania/Score.Script.txt" as Score
    
    // ---------------------------------- //
    // Settings
    // ---------------------------------- //
    #Setting S_TimeLimit	600 as _("Time limit")		///< Time limit on a map
    #Setting S_PointLimit	25	as _("Points limit")	///< Points limit on a map
```
At the beginning of your script, you have to tell to the script to look into the `ModeBase` for the basic working of the script.

Then talk about the different libraries:

* Message: You handle all the system message thanks to library (like: "A player killed you!").
* SM: Handle some general function like the spawn of the players
* Score: It's used to set the score to the players (as its name said)

Below the library you have the settings that players set when they create a server.

## Initializing the server
For a deathmatch mode (which is very simple), you have only to deactivate the team mode at the start of the server.

```c++
    ***StartServer***
    ***
    UseClans = False;
    ***
```

## Setting up the parameters for the match/map

```c++
    ***StartMap***
    ***
    G_SpawnsList.clear();
    G_LatestSpawnId = NullId;
```
    
First we clear the table containing the list of the spawns on the map and we reset the Id of the last spawn used.
    
```c++
    // ---------------------------------- //
    // Init bases
    foreach (Base in Bases) {
    	Base.Clan = 0;
    	Base.IsActive = True;
    }
```
    
Then we indicate to initialize each base possibly present in the map to use the neutral (FFA) team number (so 0).
    
```c++
    // ---------------------------------- //
    // Init scores
    MB_Sleep(1); ///< Allow the scores array to be sorted
    foreach (Score in Scores) {
    	declare Integer LastPoint for Score;
    	LastPoint = 0;
    }
```
    
The score of the players are reseted. In this portion of code, we call the class `Score` which stock all the points won by the players during a round (or match).
It's also with this class that you can put the scores of the players into the scoretable automatically.

```c++
    declare LeadId = NullId;
    if (Scores.existskey(0)) LeadId = Scores[0].User.Id;
```
    
The Id of the lead player is also reseted as the match hasn't started yet.
    
```c++
    declare CurrentPointLimit = S_PointLimit;
```
    
We put in a variable the Point Limit decided by the owner of the server (or by vote).
    
```c++
    // ---------------------------------- //
    StartTime = Now;
    EndTime = StartTime + (S_TimeLimit * 1000);
    UIManager.UIAll.UISequence = CUIConfig::EUISequence::Playing;
    ***
```
We setting up the countdown and the duration of the round/match. Fix a duration is good is most cases because it prevents the round to last too long.

## Proceedings of the round
It's now time to write what's going on during a round.

```c++
    ***PlayLoop***
    ***
    foreach (Event, PendingEvents) {
```
    
We look in each event happening during the round. When an event is trigered, according what we want to do, we do some treatments (only a very few events are listed below, the basic ones).

```c++
    	// ---------------------------------- //
    	// On armor empty
    	if (Event.Type == CSmModeEvent::EType::OnArmorEmpty) {
    		if (Event.Shooter == Event.Victim || Event.Shooter == Null) {
    			Event.Victim.Score.Points -= 1;
    		} else {
    		    Event.Victim.Score.Points -= 1;
                Event.Shooter.Score.Points += 1;
    		}
    		XmlRpc::OnArmorEmpty(Event);
    		PassOn(Event);
    	} 
```
    	
When a player lose all his armors (when he dies), we remove him one point. Then with `PassOn(Event)` we tell to the server that the event has been processed. We give also one point to the shooter if it's not a suicide.
    	
```c++
    	// ---------------------------------- //
    	// On hit
    	else if (Event.Type == CSmModeEvent::EType::OnHit) {
```
    	
Now we check when a player is hit by a projectile (from a Storm weapon).
    	
```c++
    		if (Event.Shooter == Event.Victim) {
    			Discard(Event);
```
    			
Basically if the player hit himself (with the `Arrow` or the `Nucleus` for example), we tell the server to disregard this event (and so to ignore all the damage and effects) with the `Discard(Event)` instruction.
    			
```c++
    		} else {
    			Event.Victim.Armor -= Event.Damage;
    			
    			XmlRpc::OnHit(Event);
    			PassOn(Event);
    		}
    	} 
```
    	
But if the sender and the receiver are different, we remove the number of armor (life) to the victim (the number of damage is know with the variable `Event.Damage` which can be tempered if you want to modify the damage received.
    	
```c++
    	// ---------------------------------- //
    	// On player request respawn
    	else if (Event.Type == CSmModeEvent::EType::OnPlayerRequestRespawn) {
    		Event.Player.Score.Points -= 1;
    		XmlRpc::OnPlayerRequestRespawn(Event);
    		PassOn(Event);
    	} 
```
    	
If a player press the backspace button (the default one to respawn), we remove him one point.
    	
```c++
    	// ---------------------------------- //
    	// Others
    	else {
    		PassOn(Event);
    	}
    }
```
    
And we validate all others events in their default treatment.
    
```c++
    // ---------------------------------- //
    // Spawn players
    foreach (Player in Players) {
    	if (Player.SpawnStatus == CSmPlayer::ESpawnStatus::NotSpawned && !Player.RequestsSpectate) {
    		MeleeSpawnPlayer(Player);
    	}
    }
```
    
Outside of the loop of the events, there is some work to do. First we have to let the players spawn if they are eliminated.
To do so, we create a loop who'll check all the players all the time. If a player is eliminated (by checking his status thanks to `CSmPlayer::ESpawnStatus::NotSpawned`), we ask to script to execute the function `MeleeSpawnPlayer` which will be explained a bit later).
    
```c++
    // ---------------------------------- //
    // Play sound and notice if someone is taking the lead
    if (Scores.existskey(0) && Scores[0].User.Id != LeadId) {
    	LeadId = Scores[0].User.Id;
    	Message::SendBigMessage(TextLib::Compose(_("$<%1$> takes the lead!"), Scores[0].User.Name), 3000, 1, CUIConfig::EUISound::PhaseChange, 1);
    }
```
    
We can also display a message when a player take the lead. We have to test if the player with the highest score is the same player than registered before (else we don't save the new leader).
If it's the case, we save the new leader and we display a message to all the player to warn the players that one of them has taken the lead.
    
```c++
    Message::Loop();
    
    // ---------------------------------- //
    // victory conditions
    declare IsMatchOver = False;
    if (Now > EndTime) IsMatchOver = True;
    foreach (Player in Players) {
    	if (Player.Score != Null && Player.Score.RoundPoints >= S_PointLimit) IsMatchOver = True;
    }
    
    if (IsMatchOver) MB_StopMap = True;
    ***
```
And we finish by verifying the victory conditions to end the match.
First we check if the timelimit is reached, if so, the match is ended. Else we check if the pointlimit has been reached and if so, we end the match too.

You can stop the round with the instruction `MB_StopRound = True;` and stop the match (and so going to the next map) by using `MB_StopMap = True;`. If you use one of these instructions, the script will go directly into the `EndRound` section.

We have finish to treat the playloop, but the script isn't quite finished yet.

## Ending the match
We have some code to execute in the EndMap section before having a "complete" loop of code for a match.
This section is executed when one of the victory condition is validated.

```c++
    ***EndMap***
    ***
    EndTime = -1;
    Score::RoundEnd();
    Score::MatchEnd(True);
    
    // ---------------------------------- //
    // End match sequence
    declare CUser Winner <=> Null;
    declare MaxPoints = 0;
    foreach (Score in Scores) {
    	if (Score.Points > MaxPoints) {
    		MaxPoints = Score.Points;
    		Winner <=> Score.User;
    	} else if (Score.Points == MaxPoints) {
    		Winner <=> Null;
    	}
    }
```
    
We check who is the best player (by his score).
    
```c++
    foreach (Player in Players) {
    	if (Player.User != Winner) UnspawnPlayer(Player);
    	Interface::UpdatePosition(Player);
    }
```
    
We unspawn all the players except the player who's won and we update the interface (and so the scoretable).
    
```c++
    MB_Sleep(1000);
```
    
We put the script in pause for 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
    
```c++
    Message::CleanBigMessages();
```
    
We erase all the messages displayed on the interface of the players.
    
```c++
    UIManager.UIAll.BigMessageSound = CUIConfig::EUISound::EndRound;
```
    
We play the sound of the end of the round.
    
```c++
    UIManager.UIAll.BigMessageSoundVariant = 0;
    if (Winner != Null) {
    	UIManager.UIAll.BigMessage = TextLib::Compose(_("$<%1$> wins the match!"), Winner.Name);
    } else {
    	UIManager.UIAll.BigMessage = _("|Match|Draw");
    }
    MB_Sleep(2000);
***
    UIManager.UIAll.UISequence = CUIConfig::EUISequence::EndRound;
    UIManager.UIAll.ScoreTableVisibility = CUIConfig::EVisibility::ForcedVisible;
    MB_Sleep(5000);
```

We put the players into the EndRound sequence on the level of the interface (so everything will be hidden (or will not work like when you play) except the scoretable and few others things like the chat).
And we force the visibility of the scoretable to let the players watch their scores and those of the opponents.
    
```c++
    UIManager.UIAll.UISequence = CUIConfig::EUISequence::Podium;
    while(!UIManager.UIAll.UISequenceIsCompleted) {
    	MB_Yield();
    }
```
    
If a podium is present on the map (if not the code will be ignored), we play the podium sequence.
    
```c++
    UIManager.UIAll.ScoreTableVisibility = CUIConfig::EVisibility::Normal;
    UIManager.UIAll.BigMessage = "";
    ***
```
And finally we revert back the behaviour of the scoretable and the content of the message displayed on the screen.

### The functions
But the script is not over yet, we have to create the function who will spawn the players during the round.

```c++
    Void MeleeSpawnPlayer(CSmPlayer _Player) {
    	if (G_SpawnsList.count == 0) {
    		foreach (BlockSpawn in BlockSpawns) G_SpawnsList.add(BlockSpawn.Id);
    	}
```
    	
We list all the spawns of the map (i mean the block spawn put by the map creator) if the list is empty.
    	
```c++
    	declare SpawnId = NullId;
    	while (True) {
    		SpawnId = G_SpawnsList[MathLib::Rand(0, G_SpawnsList.count - 1)];
    		if (SpawnId != G_LatestSpawnId) break;
    		if (G_SpawnsList.count == 1) break;
    	}
```
    	
We choose a spawn randomnly which will be used by the player, but it'll not the last spawn used (to prevent to have a player spawning in the same spawn of the last player in few seconds).
    	
```c++
    	G_LatestSpawnId = SpawnId;
    	SM::SpawnPlayer(_Player, 0, BlockSpawns[SpawnId]);
```

And now we spawn the player!

```c++
    	declare Removed = G_SpawnsList.remove(SpawnId);
    }
```
Then we remove the spawn of the list as it has been used.

Now you've your first working gamemode ready! Feel free to launch a local network server to test it! ^_^

## Download the source of the mode
You can download the source of the gamemode on this [link](./assets/Melee_Tuto.Script.txt).

## Going further with the ManiaScript
Of course what we saw before it's just a glimpse of what's possible with the ManiaScript. I'll show you some more advanced functions to do more things with the script.

### Specifying parameters for a player
It's possible to customized the parameters of a player when you spawn him (or while he plays but let's take the first situation).

Instead of calling the function `SM::SpawnPlayer(_Player, 0, BlockSpawns[SpawnId]);`, we'll create our own function to call to spawn of player.

```c++
    Void VSpawnPlayer(CSmPlayer _Player)
    {
    	_Player.ArmorMax 		= 400;
    	_Player.Armor 			= 400;
    	_Player.ArmorGain 		= 0;
    	_Player.AmmoGain 		= 1.;
    	_Player.AmmoPower 		= 1.;
    	_Player.SpeedPower 		= 1.;
    	_Player.IsHighlighted 	= True;
    	_Player.StaminaMax 		= 1.;
    	_Player.StaminaGain 	= 1.;
    	_Player.StaminaPower 	= 1.;
    	SetPlayerWeapon(_Player, CSmMode::EWeapon::Rocket, False);
    	SM::SpawnPlayer(_Player, 0, BlockSpawns[SpawnId], Now + 50);
    	SetPlayerAmmoMax(_Player, CSmMode::EWeapon::Rocket, 4);
    	SetPlayerAmmo(_Player, CSmMode::EWeapon::Rocket, 4);
    }
```
All the usable parameters are listed into the `CSmPlayer` class (check the technical documentation about it).

## Spawning a bot
Spawnig a bot is almost the same as spawning a player. The difference is that you have to put a BotPath on the map where the bot must be spawned.
You can differentiate a bot by another by modifying his `kind` in the map editor (with a value between 0 and 10). In the script, you'll find them like this:

```c++
    foreach(Spawn in MapLandmarks_BotPath)
    {
    	if (Spawn.BotPath.Clan == _BotClass) VSpawnBot(Spawn);
    }
```
`_BotClass` is the `kind` of the bot (so the one you search, you can put directly an integer if there is one class of bot or if you search specifically one class only).

## Displaying messages on the HUD
You have mainly two functions for displaying a message to the players (all of them or only one of them). Both functions can be use generally or targeted to a player.

The first one is with SendBigMessage which will display... well a big message at the top center of the player screen. The instruction is:

```c++
    Message::SendBigMessage(TextLib::Compose("""$<%1$> has scored!""", _Player.Name), 3000, 10);
```
    
`Message` is the call for the library declared before at the beginning of the script. We ask the script to call the function `SendBigMessage` of the `Message` library.

In the example above, the first argument is the text to display. Thanks to `Compose` function of the `TextLib` library, we can put arguments if you want to display messages that are a bit more dynamic. While you're writing the text you can add the text `$<%1$>` to tell the Compose function that you're adding an argurment that you'll fill just after. In the example, we indicate a player name (but it could be anything else). Then we indicate the duration of the message, 3000 milliseconds which equal 3 seconds.

You can specified a receiver if you indicate a CSmPlayer variable as first argument of the `SendBigMessage` function like this:

```c++
    Message::SendBigMessage(ReceiverPlayer, TextLib::Compose("""$<%1$> has scored!""", _Player.Name), 3000, 10);
```
    
Else there is another function to display message, smaller ones, on the HUD, by using the function `SendStatusMessage`:

```c++
    Message::SendStatusMessage(TextLib::Compose("""$<%1$> has scored!""", _Player.Name), 3000, 10);
```
    
It works like `SendBigMessage`.

## Using the pole on your script
If you want to use a pole in your script because is a pole based gamemode like Battle or Siege.

First you must reset the progression of the pole (to prevent to have a half-captured pole at the beginning of the round):

```c++
    ***StartRound***
    ***
    foreach(Pole in BlockPoles) {
    	Pole.Gauge.Value = 0;
    	Pole.Gauge.Max = S_CaptureMaxValue;
    	Pole.Captured = False;
    }
    ***
```
    
Then you have to manage the pole during the `Playloop`:

```c++
    foreach(Pole in BlockPoles) {
    	foreach(PlayerId in Pole.Sector.PlayersIds) {
    		declare Player <=> Players[PlayerId];
    		if(Player == Null) {
    			continue;
    		} else {
    			Pole.Gauge.Speed = 1;
    			Pole.Gauge.Max = 3000;
    			Pole.Captured = True;
    				
    			if (Pole.Gauge.Value == Pole.Gauge.Max) {
    				Player.Score.Points += 1;
    					
    				MB_StopRound = True;
    				Message::SendBigMessage(TextLib::Compose("$<%1$> has loaded the Pole!", Player.Name), 4000, 10);
    				break;
    			}
    		}
    	}
    	if (Pole.Sector.PlayersIds.count == 0) {
    		Pole.Gauge.Speed = 0;
    		Pole.Gauge.Value = 0;
    		Pole.Captured = False;
    	}
    }
```
    
In this example, we check all the pole of the map and on each of them, we check if there is a player around it, if so we are loading the pole and if the pole is loaded, we give to the player one point and we stop the round. If there is no one, the pole is reseted.

## Create and spawn an object
If you need to use a dynamic object (a 3D object that can be catched, dropped and can interact with the players and/or the bots).

First you have to declare all the dynamic objects (including mandatory skins if used) that you intend to use in your script:

```c++
    declare Ident G_MyDynamicObject;
    declare Ident G_MyMandatorySkin;
    
    ***StartServer***
    ***
    ItemList_Begin();
    	G_MyDynamicObject = ItemList_Add("aDynamicObject.Item.gbx");
    	G_MyMandatorySkin = ItemList_Add("aCustomSkin.Item.gbx");
    ItemList_End();
    ***
```
    
As you can see, you must declare a global variable as Ident to stock the desired item as reference in the `StartServer` section.

Secondly you have to create the object, once or as many times you need with those instructions:

```c++
    declare CSmObject AnObject;
    AnObject = ObjectCreate(G_MyDynamicObject);
```
    
Once created, you have (maybe, it's depending of your game design) to spawn the item on the World or on a player.

To spawn it on the world, you must check all the anchor of the map and spawn the object on them (all of them, you can't choose). The issue is that an anchor of the item must exist on the map or the item will not be spawned.

To spawn it with this method, you can do the following:

```c++
    declare CSmObjectAnchor AnObjectAnchor;
    foreach(Anchor in ObjectAnchors) {
    	if(Anchor.Tag == "NameOfTheAnchor") {
    		AnObject.SetAnchor(Anchor);
    		AnObjectAnchor = Anchor;
    		break;
    	}
    }
```
    
If you want to give it to a player, then you should do this:

```c++
    AnObject.SetPlayer(_Player);
```
    
In this way the object will be carried by the specified player. You'll be able to find the object located on a player by listing his objects with:

```c++
    aPlayer.Objects[];
```

## Drop an object from a player
For your mode you'll maybe have to drop a dynamic object (like a ball for example) from a player. To do so you'll need this kind of code:

```c++
    Void DropObject(CSmPlayer _Shooter, CSmPlayer _Victim) {
    	if(_Victim.Objects.count <= 0) return;
    	
    	declare CSmObject VictimItem = _Victim.Objects[0];
    	if(VictimItem != Null) {
    		declare Vec3 Pos;
    		declare Vec3 Vel;
    		
    		if(_Shooter != Null) {
    			Pos = _Victim.Position + <0., 3., 0.>;
    			Vel = _Shooter.Position - _Victim.Position;
    			declare Real DropForce = 5.;
    			declare Real VelNorm = MathLib::Sqrt((Vel.X*Vel.X) + (Vel.Y*Vel.Y) + (Vel.Z*Vel.Z));
    			Vel = (- (DropForce/VelNorm) * Vel)  + <0., 5., 0.>;
    		} else {
    			Pos = _Victim.Position + <0., 3., 0.>;
    			Vel = <6., 6., 6.>;
    		}
    		VictimItem.SetPositionAndVel(Pos, Vel);
    	}
    }
```
    
With this function, the object will be dropped in the opposite direction of the shot (in that way you can suppose from where the shot is from).

## The "Actions"
We'll talk a bit about the `Actions`. An `Action` is a element created in the `ActionMaker` which give you the possibility to build a new weapon or a custom animation for the player.

On a script point of view, you can assign up to 8 actions to a player at the same time from `Slot_A` to `Slot_H`.

First to use an action, you must declare on the `StartServer` section of your script and to declare it in an `ActionList`:

```c++
    declare Ident G_MyCustomWeapon;
    
    ***StartServer***
    ***
    ActionList_Begin();
    	G_MyCustomWeapon = ActionList_Add("mycustombullet.Action.Gbx");
    ActionList_End();
    ***
```
    
`G_MyCustomWeapon` must be declared as a global variable to be usable everywhere in your script. Note also that the Actions will be search in the folder `Actions` (at the root of the package tree).

### Assigning a weapon/action
To assign a weapon created with the ActionMaker to a player, you have to use the following code:

```c++
    ActionLoad(Player, CSmMode::EActionSlot::Slot_A, G_MyCustomWeapon);
    ActionBind(Player, CSmMode::EActionSlot::Slot_A, CSmMode::EActionInput::Weapon);
```
    
`CSmMode::EActionInput::Weapon` is referencing the fire button (left click usually), if you want to put an action on the right-click, you have to specify `Movement` as input instead of `Weapon`. But if you do that, the player won't be able to jump/use his stamina.

The actions can be assigned on the buttons 1, 2, 3 or 4 through `Activable1`, `Activable2`, `Activable3` and `Activable4`.

## Managing the event of an action
If you use an action as a weapon, you can't manage exactly the event the same way as a Storm bullet (rocket/nucleus/arrow/laser). You have to manage the fire and hit events on the `OnActionCustomEvent` event instead of `OnHit`.

For a bullet, the state of an action is symbolize with its first parameter: `Event.Param1[0]`. For example if you want to know if a bullet has been fired, you have to compare this parameter with the text `"fire"`.

If you want to retrieve the damage done by the bullet, you should check the second parameter of the action: `Event.Param2[0]` and be sure that the event sent by action is `"damage"` for the first parameter. Note that the parameter is a Text type, so you have to convert it with the TextLib if you want to use it directly during the calculation of the damage.

Please note also the parameters can be altered by the creator of the action (if he has customized the script of the weapon to do so).

Here is an example on how manage the event of an action:

```c++
    } else if (Event.Type == CSmModeEvent::EType::OnActionCustomEvent) {
    	if(Event.Param1 == "fire" && Event.Shooter != Null){
    		log("The Player has fired");
    
    		PassOn(Event);
    	} else if(Event.Param1 == "damage" && Event.Shooter != Null && Event.Victim != Null && Event.Victim != Event.Shooter) {
    		Event.Victim.Armor -= TextLib::ToInteger(Event.Param2[0]);
    
    		PassOn(Event);
    	}
    }
```
    
You can still manage the death of the players through the `OnArmorEmpty` event.

## The Manialink into the ManiaScript
It's possible to write some Manialink code into your script. This is useful when you want to display some custom information or even to create a complete custom ingame UI.

If you want to do so, you have first to create a text variable which will contain the manialink and then to treat the manialink:

```c++
    declare Text MLText = "<label posn="0 0 0" text="This is an example" />";
    
    declare Layer <=> Layers::Get("ExampleUI");
    if(Layer == Null) Layer::Create("ExampleUI", MLText);
    
    Layer <=> Layers::Get("ExampleUI");
    Layer.Type = CUILayer::EUILayerType::Normal;
    Layers::Attach("ExampleUI", Player);
```
    
In the example, once you have stocked your manialink into the text variable, you check if a layer (of the UI) already has the desired name for the layer. If not, we create it and then we specify the type of the layer and we attch it to the UI of the player.

> **Tip:** You can add a multilines content text variable by using the delimiter `"""` instead of `""`. By doing this you can write on 10 lines with the formatting and then indicate the end of the content to add in the variable.

At the end of the round (or the map), i recommend to destroy all the layers to not have redondant information on the screen of the player. To destroy the layers, you must use this instruction directly in the script:

```c++
    Layers:DestroyAll();
```
    
### ManiaScript into the Manialink
You can use some ManiaScript in your Manialink too and even to have access to few script elements directly in your Manialink or the ManiaScript of the Manialink.

Please note that you can't use some of the ManiaScript functions and variable while you're in a Manialink.

First to use some ManiaScript in your Manialink, you have to write the ManiaScript code after the Manialink code like this:

```c++
    Text MyManialink() {
    	declare Text MLText = """
    		<quad id="aQuad" posn="0 0 0" sizen="360 180" halign="center" image="./Media/Manialinks/MyImage.dds" />
    		<script><!--
    		main() {
    			declare Integer aVar = 0;
    
    			declare aQuad	 		<=> (Page.GetFirstChild("aQuad") 		as CMlQuad);
    			
    			aQuad.Show();		
    			
    			while(True) {
    				yield;
    				
    				// EVENT
    				foreach(Event in PendingEvents) {		
    					if(Event.Type == CMlEvent::Type::MouseClick) {
    						if(Event.ControlId == "aQuad") {
    							log("I clicked on a quad");
    					}
    				}
    			}
    		}
    		--></script>
    	""";
    
    	declare Layer <=> Layers::Get("ExampleUI");
    	Layer.Type = CUILayer::EUILayerType::Normal;
        Layers::Attach("ExampleUI", Player);
    }
```

In this example you can see how works the ManiaScript in the Manialink. Once you've written your ManiaLink you can start writting your script between the tag `<script><!-- //code --></script>`. In this portion of code you can use the ManiaScript present into the `CSmMIScriptIngame`, `CMlControl` and `CMlPage` classes.

Note that you can check several events like the different sort of clicks of the mouse on the elements (like Quad, Label, Gauge, etc).

If you want that the script is running during all the time it's attach to the UI of the player, you should put it in a loop and put the code there, else the code will be executed only when the layer will be attached.

> **Tip:** Note that GUIPlayer in `CSmMIScriptIngame` is very useful because you have access to the attributes of the CSmPlayer attributes with it.
> 
> **Tip:** You call variables from the main script if you put a triple brackets between the name of the variable like this: `{{{S_PointLimit}}}`. But with this method you can't manipulate them (like doing calculation, modification). See below to know how to do it properly.

#### Sending ManiaScript script variables to the ManiaScript Manialink variables and vice versa
First you need to know that the script of the gamemode and the manialink inside are two separate layers which don't communicate between them initially. The script is run on the server while the manialink is read locally on the computer of the player. To make it so, you need to use a "new" type of variable chich will be read by the script and the manialink.

It works like an "input/output" system in simple language. In a logic sense, you must create first an "output" variable, symbolized with the parameter `netwrite` in ManiaScript. This parameter tell that the variable will register/put a value to send to the other layer (the script or the manialink):

```c++
    declare netwrite Integer Srv_MyVariable for UI;
```
    
The "for UI" means that the variable is adressed to a specific player (first you have to retrieve the UI of the player with the instruction `declare UI <=> UIManager.GetUI(Player);`).

> **Tip:** Instead of retrieving all the UIs if the variable is addressed for all players, you can specify `for Teams[0]` for FFA modes or `Teams[1]` or `Teams[2]` for a specific team on team modes.

> **Info:** This type of variable (netwrite/netread) doesn't work with the bots, it'll crash the script if you try do it, so be sure that when you manipulate this type of variable in the script, to exclude the bot from the execution of the code (**Tip:** the bot doesn't have an UI, so you can do a check when you have retrieve the UI of a player by test it with `if(UI != Null)`).

You have to create an "input" variable on the side where you will receive the value of the other part (for example from the script to the variable) with the `netread` parameter between the declaration and the type of the variable:

```c++
    declare netread Integer Srv_MyReadVariable for UI;
```

> **Note:** You can't name a netread/netwrite variable with the same name of an existing "standard" variable (name conflict)

> **Important:** You can't manipulate the value of a `netread` variable (or the script will crash)
