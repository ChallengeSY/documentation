# XML-RPC reference

[XML-RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC) is the protocol that allows [external tools](tools/index.html) to communicate with Maniaplanet dedicated server (and the script running in the server). The only major difference with *standard* XML-RPC is the transport used, which is not HTTP.
