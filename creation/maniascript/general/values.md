simply a boolean value:
which can be either True or False

```

Text
=====
Text is basically a string value known from many other languages. The maniascript doesn't have value for character, and text is always defined in double quotes ".

You can also use triple quotes to mark multiline text.

Triple curly brackets to escape the quotes for variables:

example: 

```
declare Text description = """ Hello {{{name}}},
How are you today ? """;
You can use ^ operator to join a Text with another Text or numeric value.
In Text a newline can be used "\n" and you can also escape with "\\".

examples:
declare Text name = "ManiaPlanet";
declare Text test = "Hello" ^ name;
log(test) // output: Hello ManiaPlanet

```
