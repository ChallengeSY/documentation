Where to write your script ? The short version.
========

The way to create or change a script depends on the type of script you want.
 - To edit a GameMode, launch a solo or LAN game, and press Ctrl + ScrollLock. If you want to create a new one, lanch an existing one, then press Ctrl + ScrollLock, then SaveAs with a new name.
 - To edit or create an map-editor plugin, use the plugin menu (the "fork" icon) in the editor
 - To have a script in a manialink XML file, add a <script> ... </script> part in the manialink XML file
 
 
GameModes
========

GameModes for Trackmania and Shootmania are located in the "" folder of your Maniaplanet User directory (Usually "My Documents/Maniaplanet")
