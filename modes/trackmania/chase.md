# Chase

## Introduction

Chase is a team based mode available in Trackmania.

## Rules

In Chase mode, the goal is to cross the finish line first with its team or scoring enough points to outrun the opponents. A match is divided in several rounds, by default a team must win three rounds to win a match. 

During each round the players will race as usual with one additional constraint. The last player to cross a checkpoint for its team has to be the first to cross the next one. If the right player crosses the checkpoint, he scores one point for its team.

Example :
Checkpoint 1 : 1st Player A, 2nd Player B and 3rd Player C
Checkpoint 2 : 1st player must be Player C, the following players can be anyone, let's say 2nd Player A, 3rd Player B.
Checkpoint 3 : 1st player must be Player B.

A round can be won in four ways :
* having a big enough points advantage over the opponents (by default 3)
* crossing the finish line first
* opponents retire from the race
* time limit is reached

In case of time limit, the following criteria are used to determine the round winner :
* team with the most points
* team who crossed the most checkpoints
* team with the best time at the latest checkpoint

## Tips
* Don't wait the last moment to let the next checkpoint player go ahead, it would force you to brake and stop just before the checkpoint.
* If your team have a big enough points advantage your players can sprint to the finish a few checkpoints before the end without respecting the players order at the checkpoints.

## Map validation

Chase can be played on any type of map, but it's better to use maps with laps or really long maps.
