# Melee

## Introduction

Melee is a free for all mode available in the Storm title pack of Shootmania.

## Rules

Melee is a mode where players must score as many points as they can before the match goal is reached, or until time expires.

The rules are very simple. Players score points by connecting hits to other players.

## Tips

* Not much to say in this simple mode. Just play the best you can!
* Respawning and self elimination in this mode costs a point

## Map validation

The editor simply places as many spawns as he or she would like
