# Royal

## Introduction

Royal is a free for all mode available in the Royal title pack of Shootmania.

## Rules

Royal is a mode where players must score as many points as they can before the match goal is reached. A match is divided into multiple rounds.

The rules are not so simple. At the beginning of each round, players start at the spawns and attempt to push towards the goal post, exchanging shots with each other on the way.

Once the goal post has been captured, further respawning is disabled, and a tornado is activated, slowly shrinking the playfield in the process until the space around the goal post is minimal. Players caught outside the tornado are eliminated.

The round ends when either only one player remains, or when time expires after the playfield size has been minimized. All the points earned during the round, be it from connecting hits, surviving longer in a round, or capturing, are totaled up. Assuming the match goal is not reached, the next round then begins.

## Tips

* Normally, a player has two armor at the start of each round. Players that get eliminated before goal capture respawn with one armor

## Map validation

* As many spawns as desired. Priorities may be assigned at each spawn
* Exactly one goal post
