## Letters customization
If you want to customize a sentence or a word, there is several ways to do it. First you can learn those quick tag to ammend to your content. Or you can use a site like [Nickr](http://nickr.brun.pl/).

* **$w:** allows you to enlarge the width of the nickname.
* **$n:** allows you to reduce the width of the nickname.
* **$o:** puts the nickname in bold.
* **$i:** puts the nickname in italics.
* **$t:** allows you to put the text in capitals.
* **$s:** adds a drop shadow effect to the nickname.
* **$$:** allows you to write the '$' sign.
* **$g:** applies the default colour.
* **$z:** allows you to restore the default text style.

***N.B.***: It is possible to add colour to nicknames by using the 3-character hexadecimal code of the desired colour, preceded by the '$' sign. For example, $08FNadeo, in order to write <span style="color:blue">Nadeo</span> in blue. Another example, ***$o$t$08FNadeo*** will give <span style="color:blue">'''NADEO'''</span> (that is to say Nadeo in bold, in capitals and in blue).

Use the following characters: $000 to $fff

The colour codes are the 3 numbers after the $ and have 16 values 0 to f (0123456789abcdef).<br />
The first character is the red colour pallet . The second one is the green one and the third the blue one.

Here are some examples of colours:  
$000: black  
$f00: red  
$0f0: green  
$00f: blue  
$f80: orange  
$ff0: yellow  
$f0f: pink  
$0ff: light blue  
$888: grey  
$fff: white
